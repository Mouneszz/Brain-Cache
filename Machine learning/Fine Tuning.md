Below is a detailed, step-by-step workflow covering every major phase of fine-tuning, exporting, and running a custom LLM with Ollama. The format is tailored for direct use in Obsidian.

# Detailed Workflow: Fine-Tuning and Deploying an LLM with Ollama

## 1. Define Your Task & Gather Data

- Decide the custom requirement (e.g., extracting structured data from HTML, specialized question answering).
    
- Gather relevant examples for fine-tuning (minimum hundreds, ideally thousands).
    
- Format as pairs: “input” (prompt) and “output” (expected response), typically as JSON.
    
- Check data quality, consistency, and variety to ensure robust model behavior.
    

## 2. Prepare Your Environment (Google Colab/Local Machine)

- For cloud: Open Google Colab for GPU access (recommended for most users).
    
- For local: Ensure an NVIDIA GPU and install CUDA drivers.
    
- Install Python, pip, and core packages (PyTorch, Transformers, Unsloth).
    
- Upload your dataset to Colab or place it in your working directory locally.
    

## 3. Install and Import Dependencies

- Run installation commands in your notebook or terminal:
    
    - `pip install unsloth torch transformers`
        
- Restart runtime after installation (if prompted).
    
- Import all relevant Python packages for model loading, data processing, and training.
    

## 4. Load, Inspect, and Format Dataset

- Read your JSON file into Python. Use `json.load()` for reading.
    
- Inspect sample entries to verify structure.
    
- Write a formatting function:
    
    - Combines each input and output into a single training string, separated by line breaks or tokens like `<|endoftext|>`.
        
    - Ensures output is string-encoded and matches the required model structure.
        

## 5. Select and Load Base Model

- Choose an open-source compatible model (e.g., Phi-3-mini, Llama, Mistral).
    
- Call Unsloth’s model loading functions, specifying the correct sequence length and quantization (often 4-bit for fast, low-memory tuning).
    
- Load corresponding tokenizer to preprocess prompts.
    

## 6. Add and Configure LoRA Adapters

- Use Unsloth to attach LoRA adapters to your base model.
    
- Configure LoRA hyperparameters (rank, alpha, dropout) for your task and model size.
    
- LoRA adapters enable efficient, memory-light fine-tuning by training only small, new matrices.
    

## 7. Prepare Data for Trainer

- Apply your formatting function to all dataset examples.
    
- Package formatted data as a Hugging Face dataset, with the primary field labeled “text.”
    
- Set up data splits if you want to monitor validation performance.
    

## 8. Initialize the SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) Trainer

- Pass in the patched model, tokenizer, prepared dataset, and key training arguments:
    
    - Max sequence length (controls prompt size and memory usage).
        
    - Batch size (optimize based on available GPU memory).
        
    - Number of epochs (iterations over your data).
        
    - Learning rate and warmup ratio (tuning choices for optimization).
        
    - Output directory (for checkpoints/saved model).
        

## 9. Fine-Tune Your Model

- Start training and monitor progress. Watch for:
    
    - Loss decreasing steadily (preferably not erratic).
        
    - GPU utilization in Colab or local terminal.
        
- If errors surface (e.g., OOM, incompatible data), adjust batch/sequence sizes or debugging dataset formatting.
    

## 10. Evaluate & Test Model Inference

- After training, switch model into inference mode.
    
- Prepare test prompts, ideally new unseen examples.
    
- Run predictions and verify output for format, correctness, and consistency.
    
- Run multiple examples; note any failures/odd outputs to understand limitations.
    

## 11. Export Model to GGUF Format

- After satisfactory testing, use Unsloth’s `model.save_pretrain_gguf()` function (or equivalent) to export the model.
    
- Choose the quantization quality (Q4, Q5, etc.) balancing speed, size, and accuracy.
    
- Result: a .gguf binary file, ready for Ollama use.
    

## 12. Transfer Model to Local Machine

- Download the .gguf file from Colab or move it from your workstation.
    
- Place the .gguf file in a dedicated model directory for Ollama.
    

## 13. Write and Configure a Modelfile

- Create a new Modelfile (capital “M”) in the same directory; specify:
    
    - `FROM <gguf_filename>` to point to the exported model.
        
    - Template parameters (input structure: user/assistant roles).
        
    - Stop tokens (where generation should halt).
        
    - Temperature/top-p for output randomness/control.
        
    - Optional system prompt for context.
        
- Example snippet:
    
    text
    
    `FROM ./your-model.gguf TEMPLATE user {prompt} assistant PARAMETER stop=<|endoftext|> PARAMETER temperature=0.7 SYSTEM "You are a helpful AI assistant."`
    

## 14. Register Model with Ollama

- Open a terminal and use:
    
    - `ollama create <model-name> -f Modelfile`
        
- Confirm successful addition with:
    
    - `ollama list`
        

## 15. Run the Fine-Tuned Model Locally

- Execute: `ollama run <model-name>`
    
- Paste real prompts to interact with the fine-tuned LLM.
    
- Evaluate output, troubleshoot with new data/examples as needed.
    

## 16. Integrate with Applications (Optional)

- Use Ollama’s API to connect your local model to Python scripts, web apps, or automation workflows.
    
- Enjoy fast, private inference suited to your custom requirements.
