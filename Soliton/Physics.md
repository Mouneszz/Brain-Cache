**Potential Energy**
- Energy of an object due to its position and condition is called potential energy.
- `PE = mgh`
-  m is mass
-  g is acceleration due to gravity/ 9.8 m/s^2
-  h is height
Kinetic Energy 
- Energy due to the motion of the object is called Kinetic Energy.
- `KE = 1/2mv^2`
-  m is the mass of the object 
-   v is the velocity of the object

Ohms law
`V = IR`
- V = voltage
- I = Current
- R = Resistance
`I = Q/T`
- I = current
- Q  = Charge
- T = Time in Seconds
`P = VI / P = I^2R`
-  P  = Power
-  V = Voltage
-  I  = Current
