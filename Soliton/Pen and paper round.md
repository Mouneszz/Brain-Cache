Math/Aptitude:
1. A function is said to be an odd function when f(x) =-f(x). For the function f(x) = x2 – nx + 4 to be even, find the value of n.
2. A shape as shown in the picture is formed by joining five cubes of side 2 cm. The cube is painted on its outer side as shown. If each square cm requires 2 ml of paint. Find the total amount of paint required to paint the shape formed.

Physics:
3. Given the equation for work done(W) and displacement(s) in terms of t, find the power.
4. Given a circuit with four resistors connected to a source, find the power. R1 = R2 = R3 = 3 ohms, R4 = 0.5 ohm
5. Given two input waveforms and an output waveform, find the operation to be performed on the input waves to get the resultant waveform.
6. Given a logic gate circuit, find the total time duration of HIGH(1) output signal.

C program:
7. Find the operation that is being performed in the given flowchart. Flow chart will be given.
   **Answer:** Finding factorial of input number N and printing the result.
8. Find the output of the given program.
9. Find the output of the given program. The question was with string and pointers. The string is “COMPILE”, one pointer sp1 is at the start of the character array, another pointer sp2 was at the end. Loop through the length of the string, and inside the loop assign *sp1 to *sp2, also string[i] = *sp1.
