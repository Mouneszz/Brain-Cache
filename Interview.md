### **What are Transformers, and why are they important?** 

“Transformers are a deep learning architecture based on self-attention, introduced in 2017. They allow models to capture relationships between words regardless of distance, unlike RNNs or LSTMs. This made them the foundation of state-of-the-art models like BERT and GPT. Hugging Face focuses on Transformers because they became the standard in NLP and beyond, and their library makes them easy to use in practice.”
