Normal way of creation
```mysql
create table employees(
	employee_id int primary key,
	employee_name varchar(100) not null,
	employee_age int not null
);
```
here we simply create a table with three columns and having different constraints key.

***CTAS***

Here we create a new table from an existing  table  with using a where condition method.
```mysql
create table youngemployee as 
select
 employee_id,
 employee_name,
 employee_age
 from employees 
 where employee_age <=30;
```
`as` and `select` are important as it is used to reference the existing  table, we dont have to have all the columns as in the new table we can also limit it.

**Temporary  table**
When we need to create a table which we dont want to save in the main database after the execution of the all the sql queries , we can create a temporary table.
```mysql
create temporary table tablename (
	name varchar(100) not null;
	age int not null;
	phone_number int unique
);
```
