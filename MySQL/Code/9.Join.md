### Important things to know ###
-  Table left to the join is left table, right to the table is right table.
-  when we left join or right join, the not matched values will have null



When we have to join two tables.
**JOIN**//Inner join
only give the records  which have common in both tables.
```mysql
select 
h.name,
o.date
from hotels h
join orders o on h.id == o.id;
```
here we have  to alias a name because the name `id`  can be in two table .
In the above query we get hotel name and order date which have same id.

**Left join**
Here it will give the entire left table and and also right which matches left 
```mysql 
select 
r.h_name as name,
r.C as location,
o.date
from hotels r
left join orders o on r.hotel_id = o.h_id;
```
this will give all the `h_name` and `location` from  the hotels table and gives only the matching `date` from orders table
- The `h_name` which dont have matching order date will give `none` as `null`.
- The date column will not contain not matched dates from orders table.

**Right Join**
Here Its opposite to left join.
- it gives every  thing in right table but only gives the matching in left.
```mysql
select 
r.h_name as name,
r.location as location,
o.o_name
from hotels r
right join orders o on r.hotel_id = o.h_id;
```

**Full Join**
Merging both tables and put null for the values without fields.
But my sql  dont have it  so we have to left join right join then union them.

**Self join**
Joining same table  is called as self join.
