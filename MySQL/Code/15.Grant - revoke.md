To create a user 
```mysql
CREATE USER 'user1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';

```
we can also change `localhost` to `%`
`localhost`-  user can connect only from local machine
`%` - can connect from any IP address

**Grant**
To grant all privileges to all databases and tables inside those
```mysql
grant all privileges on *.* to `user1`@'localhost`;
```
The first `*` is all  database we can specify the database
The second `*` is all table we can specify the tables

Granting only select in table_1 from database_1 to user1
```mysql
grant select on database_1.table_1 to `user1`@'localhost`;
```

Revoke
To remove all things we granted
```mysql
revoke select on database_1.table_1 from `user1`@'localhost`;
```
