 Writing a select inside another select  can be called as sub query.
```mysql
select product,
(select max(amount) from customer_data) as max_amount_from_customer_data
from customers;
```
here we are getting a aggregated value from another table `customer_data` and showing it with `customers` table.

Using subquery inside where 
```mysql
select name from dummy1 
where id in(
    select id from dummy2 
    where amount<10000);
```
here it checks if the id in dummy1 is where in id in dummy2 where amount is < 10000.


**Subquery using from**
So to create a subquery using `from`
```mysql
select 
length_name,
name,
first_three_char
from(
select 
	length(name) as length_name,
	upper(name) as name,
	concat(name,' - ',city) as name_with_city,
	substring(name,1,3) as first_three_char
	from customer_data) as subquerry
```
The important thing is to close the subquery using brackets and we have to remove the semicolon also
