When we have to check the number of records which contains null 
we can not use `=` 
`is`
```mysql
select count(*) from students where phone_number is null;
-- same for not null also 
select count(*) from students where phone_number is not null;
```

when we have to check for rows/records with out any null
```mysql
select * from students_contact where phone_number is not null and email is not null;
```

### The real null handling ###
When we have null but we dont want it as a null we have to handle those nulls.

`coalesce`
`coalesce(null,null,'0.00',null,'11`);
In coalesce it will return the first not null 
```mysql
select 
name,
coalesce (amount,'0.00') as amount
from customer_data;
```
Here the `null` in the records will now change into what ever a first not null value in  the coalesce.

`ifnull`
it is similar to coalesce but we can only give two arguments inside it.
```mysql
select 
name,
ifnull(amount,'0.00') as amount
from customer_data;
```
