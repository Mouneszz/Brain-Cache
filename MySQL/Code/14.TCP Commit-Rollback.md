**Transaction**
- We have to start transaction to commit and rollback
- It is like a space process takes place in the database
- we can either commit or rollback 
```mysql
start transaction;
```
Doing process like updating, deleting we should start transactions so we can roll back if we done something or if its ok we can commit it to save.
```mysql 
rollback; --  to undo the transaction
```

To save the changes you made after the transaction we have to commit.
```mysql
commit;
```
After commit we can not roll back undo the process.
