When we have to merge two or more columns we have to use union.
`union all` -  merge all but also give the duplicates  also.
`union` - dont allow duplicates
**IMPORTANT** -  The number of columns in the each select should be equal.

**union all**
```mysql
select * from employees
union all
select * from parttimers;

```

**union**
```mysql
select * from employees
union 
select * from parttimers;
```
here it check all column because of the start if will only remove a row if it have all the column(which mentioned in the select matches).
 - even if , In two tables if two records have two different `id`. but we only select the name(they have same) and union them, then that considered as duplicate and only one show(select).
