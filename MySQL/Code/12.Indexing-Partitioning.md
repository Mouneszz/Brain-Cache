**To not want to do full scan, for time optimization we have to indexing and partitioning.**
creating a index for a specific columns (which we most use in condition like where)
- Used for performance optimization
```mysql
create index email_id on users(email);
```
here by creating index for email can reduce the  time.
To view this:
```mysql
explain analyze
select *
from users
where email  = "john.doe@example.com";
```

**Partition**
Partition  huge chunks of records based on specific column
-  example: we can create  partition for years column, so for viewing something we dont have to view all the year we can just visit that partition year.

**Range partition**
 - creating partition for a range
```mysql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    sale_date DATE primary key
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(sale_date)) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2021),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2022),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```
to access select by partition pruning.
```mysql
explain format=json 
select * from sales where sale_date = '2021-03-22';
```

**List partition**
-  Partitioning based on a specific column.

```mysql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(20)
)
PARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS(department) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES IN ('HR', 'Finance'),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES IN ('IT', 'Engineering'),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')
);

```

**Hash Partition**
When we want to create partition for unique attributes.
```mysql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    sale_date DATE not null,
    primary key(id,sale_date)
)
partition by hash(id)
partition 3;
```
here it will create 3 partitions 
example:
- id =7 than `7%3=1` (id 7) will be under partition 1
- id = 6 than `6%3=0` (id 6) will be under the partition 0
- id  = 8 than `8%3=2`(id 8) will be under the partition 2
Here  it will scan the partition which the  id is present.

### **Difference between Indexing and Partition**

Indexing:
- In indexing we are not dividing the table physically we are only creating a logic for the lookup by creating a specific column as index

Partition:
- Here we are creating physical partitions, so when we have to select a row a partition which contains that row is only visited and others partitions are omitted.
