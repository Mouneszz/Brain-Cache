creating a index for a specific columns (which we most use in condition like where)
- Used for performance optimization
```mysql
create index email_id on users(email);
```
here by creating index for email can reduce the  time.
To view this:
```mysql
explain analyze
select *
from users
where email  = "john.doe@example.com";
```

**Partition**
Partition  huge chunks of records based on specific column
-  example: we can create  partition for years column, so for viewing something we dont have to view all the year we can just visit that partition year.

**Range partition**
 - creating partition for a range
```mysql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    sale_date DATE primary key
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(sale_date)) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2021),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2022),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```
to access select by partition pruning.
```mysql
explain format=json 
select * from sales where sale_date = '2021-03-22';
```

**List partition**
-  Partitioning based on a specific column.

```mysql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(20)
)
PARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS(department) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES IN ('HR', 'Finance'),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES IN ('IT', 'Engineering'),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')
);

```
