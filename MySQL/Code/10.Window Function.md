So if we use aggregate function the result row size will be changed.
- To tackle that we have to use window function so **the result row size is same as the table size**.
Example:
- If we have to find the total earning of each store we can use `sum()` and group by  `store_name` but if we want to have  transaction id with these
- Like we need the same table but with an extra column which have the total earning of the shop.

Syntax:
- The having an `over()` next to a normal aggregate function.
- In `over()` we can give two arguments.
- `partition by` and `order by`
`partition by ----` -  only does the operation(aggregation) for -----. 
`order by ` similar to normal but 

```mysql
select tran_id,s_name,amount,
 sum(amount) over (partition by s_name order by tran_id desc) as Total_amount
from shops;
```
here it the original  table size is not changed it create a new column  as `Total_amount` and add that to every respective column.
- Every shop `A` will have the sum of all A amount in  a specific column .
- Order by   - order `tran_id` by  partition by partition.
