**Local Host:**
- It is like calling yourself from your home.
- It does not query a DNS server(No lookup) and get back the website from the server unlike other websites
- local host  is mapped to `127.0.0.1` - Predefined IP address.

**Domain Name System**
- DNS translates human-readable domain names (like `www.google.com`) into IP addresses (like `142.250.195.78`) that computers use to identify each other.
- It is used when fetching the web we are looking for.

**IP Address** 
- A unique address for every device which is connected to the internet.
- what is the diff between the IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 only have 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- IPv6 have 340 undecillion unique addresses.

**What is happening when browsing**
- You type www.google.com in the browser.
- The browser asks the DNS system to find the IP address.
- DNS resolves the domain into an IP address (like 142.250.195.78).
- Using that IP, your browser sends a request to the actual web server.
- The web server responds with the website content, and you see the page.
