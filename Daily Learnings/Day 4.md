## **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**

- Encrypts data on sender’s device and decrypts only on receiver’s device.
- Uses public/private key pairs + session keys for secure messaging.
- Protects in transit fully; servers store only ciphertext.
- At rest protection depends on device encryption and backup settings.
- Common in Signal, WhatsApp, iMessage (with encrypted backups for full security).

**Python input getting as a list**

```python
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
```
map is to map the split input into int
