Absolutely! Here's a **quick revision summary** of everything you've covered so far in **Operating Systems (OS)** — clear, structured, and interview-ready:

---

## 🧠 **1. Deadlock**

### ✅ **4 Necessary Conditions** (Coffman Conditions):

1. **Mutual Exclusion** – At least one resource is held in non-shareable mode.
2. **Hold and Wait** – A process holding resources waits for additional ones.
3. **No Preemption** – Resources cannot be forcibly taken.
4. **Circular Wait** – A circular chain of processes exists, each waiting for a resource held by the next.

### 🛡️ **Deadlock Prevention**

* **Mutual Exclusion** → Avoid if resources can be shared.
* **Hold and Wait** → Request all resources at once.
* **No Preemption** → Allow forcefully taking resources.
* **Circular Wait** → Impose a global ordering on resource acquisition.

## 📦 **2. Paging**

### 📌 Definition:

Paging is a **memory management** technique where **logical memory is divided into pages** and **physical memory into frames**.

* **Pages (Logical)**: Fixed-size chunks of a process’s address space.
* **Frames (Physical)**: Fixed-size chunks of RAM.

🔄 **Page Table** maps pages to frames.

### 🎯 **Why Paging?**

* Eliminates **external fragmentation**.
* Allows **non-contiguous** memory allocation.

---

## 📐 **3. Segmentation**

### 📌 Definition:

Segmentation divides the logical address space based on **logical divisions like code, data, stack**, etc.

* Each segment has a **base** and **limit**.
* More aligned with how programs are **logically structured**.

---

## 🧮 **4. Virtual Memory**

### 📌 Definition:

Virtual memory is a memory management technique that gives the **illusion of a large main memory** using disk (secondary storage).

* Allows execution of **larger programs** than physical memory.
* Uses **paging** + **page replacement algorithms**.

---

## 🔁 **5. Page Replacement Algorithms**

Used when a page fault occurs and memory is full.

### 📌 FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

* Removes the **oldest loaded page**.
* Simple but can be inefficient.

### 📌 LRU (Least Recently Used)

* Removes the **page not used for the longest time**.
* Better performance but needs tracking.

---

## 💡 **6. Logical Address Space**

### 📌 Definition:

The **address space generated by the CPU** (used by the process) before being translated to physical memory.

* Also called **virtual address**.
* Uses **page tables** for translation.

---

## 🧵 **7. Process Flow Overview**

### From Program to Execution:

1. Program stored on disk.
2. **Loaded into memory**, divided into pages.
3. **PCB (Process Control Block)** is created:

   * PID, PC, registers, memory info, etc.
4. CPU picks process → uses **Program Counter (PC)** to fetch the next instruction.
5. During context switch → **PC saved in PCB**.
6. When resumed → **PC restored from PCB** to CPU.

---

## 🧠 **8. Program Counter (PC) in PCB**

* While running: PC is in CPU.
* On pause/switch: PC is stored in PCB.
* On resume: PC from PCB is loaded back to CPU.

---

## ⚙️ **9. Components of Operating System**

* **Process Management** – Scheduling, creation, termination.
* **Memory Management** – Allocation and deallocation.
* **File System** – File storage, access, and management.
* **Device Management** – Handling I/O devices.
* **Security & Protection**
* **User Interface** – Command-line or GUI.

---

## 🔧 **10. Components of CPU**

* **ALU** – Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
* **Control Unit** – Directs operations of the processor.
* **Registers** – Small fast storage (PC, IR, etc.).
* **Program Counter (PC)** – Points to the next instruction.
* **Cache** – High-speed memory close to CPU.
