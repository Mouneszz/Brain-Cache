- When we say **"switching the CPU for multiple processes,"** it means that the CPU is allocated to different processes at different times to maximize efficiency and resource utilization.
- A modern **CPU** can have multiple **cores**, where each core acts as an independent processing unit capable of executing its own instructions. When discussing **CPU scheduling**, if a system has only **one core**, it can run only **one process at a time**, and scheduling determines **which process gets the core next**.

***BURST TIME***
- **CPU Burst**: The period when a process is actively using the CPU to perform computations or execute instructions.
- **I/O Burst**: The period when a process is waiting for or performing input/output operations (like reading from disk or waiting for user input).
