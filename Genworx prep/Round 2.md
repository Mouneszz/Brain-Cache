### 1. ✅ **Amazon Delivery System**

- 💡 **DSA Concepts**: Graph (Dijkstra), Knapsack (0/1)
    
- 🔍 **Use Case**: Cities are graph nodes, roads are edges with weights (delivery time). Dijkstra’s finds the shortest delivery path. Truck has limited capacity → apply 0/1 knapsack to maximize high-priority deliveries.
    
- 🔁 **Add-ons**: Union-Find for route validation, Topological sort for delivery dependencies.

### 2. ✅ **Uber Driver Matching**

- 💡 **DSA Concepts**: Priority Queue (Min-Heap), HashMap
    
- 🔍 **Use Case**: Riders need nearest drivers. HashMap maps zones → list of drivers. Min-heap helps choose the closest or highest-rated driver.
    
- 🔁 **Add-ons**: Graph to track driver movement, sliding window for time-based scheduling.

### 3. ✅ **TinyURL (URL Shortener)**

- 💡 **DSA Concepts**: HashMap, Base62 Encoding
    
- 🔍 **Use Case**: Short URLs are created using base62 encoding from a counter. HashMap maps short → long URLs. Handles uniqueness and O(1) lookup.
    
- 🔁 **Add-ons**: Reverse mapping for idempotency, Redis for cache, DB sharding for scalability.

### 4. ✅ **Netflix Recommendation System**

- 💡 **DSA Concepts**: Max Heap, HashMap, Sliding Window
    
- 🔍 **Use Case**: Maintain top-K trending shows. HashMap counts views, max heap tracks top K. Sliding window maintains recent views.
    
- 🔁 **Add-ons**: LRU cache for recent history, graph for user similarity, DP for prediction scores.

### 5. ✅ **WhatsApp Messaging System**

- 💡 **DSA Concepts**: Queue, Graph, OOP
    
- 🔍 **Use Case**: Messages use queues for ordered delivery. Group chats can be modeled as graphs. Classes represent users, groups, and messages.
    
- 🔁 **Add-ons**: Priority queue for server-level delivery ordering, DB partitioning.

### 6. ✅ **Swiggy / Zomato Order Delivery**

- 💡 **DSA Concepts**: Graph (shortest delivery path), Greedy, HashMap
    
- 🔍 **Use Case**: Assign orders to delivery agents based on distance & ETA. Greedy selection minimizes delivery time.
    
- 🔁 **Add-ons**: Min-heap for ETA, clustering nearby orders (K-means or Union-Find).
    

---

### 7. ✅ **Google Maps Navigation**

- 💡 **DSA Concepts**: Graph (A* Algorithm, Dijkstra), Priority Queue
    
- 🔍 **Use Case**: Cities/junctions as nodes, roads as weighted edges. A* finds the optimal path using distance + heuristic (e.g., traffic).
    
- 🔁 **Add-ons**: Real-time traffic (sliding window), rerouting using BFS fallback.
    

---

### 8. ✅ **YouTube Trending Tab**

- 💡 **DSA Concepts**: Heap, HashMap, Sliding Window
    
- 🔍 **Use Case**: Track most viewed videos in last 24 hours. Use hash to count views, heap for top K trending, and sliding window for time range.
    
- 🔁 **Add-ons**: Segmented counters for time slices, caching for top videos.
    

---

### 9. ✅ **Elevator Scheduling System**

- 💡 **DSA Concepts**: Queue, Greedy, State Machine
    
- 🔍 **Use Case**: Requests are stored in queues. Greedy strategy used to minimize idle movement. State machine tracks idle, up, down.
    
- 🔁 **Add-ons**: Priority queue for urgent floors, graph if multiple elevators coordinate.
    

---

### 10. ✅ **Job Scheduling System (e.g., OS Scheduler or Cron)**

- 💡 **DSA Concepts**: Greedy, Interval Scheduling, Heap
    
- 🔍 **Use Case**: Tasks with start/end times. Use greedy algorithm to schedule max jobs without overlap. Min-heap for earliest finishing tasks.
    
- 🔁 **Add-ons**: Graph for dependency jobs, DP for weighted jobs.
