So graph is not structure like tree where   the elements are binded into a structure , 

**Graph is just n number of elements which are having n number of relationships with n number of elements .**

All trees are graph .

Important points:
 A checker array is important as it can tell if a node i visited or not.
 The adjacent array  is the blue print of graph as it have all the relations and edge sharing details.
