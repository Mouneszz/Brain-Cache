1.
```cpp
vector<int> adj[n];
```


2.
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> adj;
```

1 . In List the index i represents the node and the values in the vector<int> adj[i] represents the nodes that are connected to it.

2. In this  the Initialization can be both used for matrix and list so  use thing can be more easy and useful.
